# Music and Sound Generation
This repository is all about generating AI sound or music using the HuggingFace[**Transformers**] library and training the music generation model using **PyTorch**. 

The libraries used for this project are as specified 
1. `Transformers`[`HuggingFace`] - Using *pretrained models* for language and audio tasks
2. `PyTorch` - Deep Learning framework for *model building and training*
3. `Matplotlib` - Data visualisation for music analysis
4. `Pydub` - Audio *file conversion and manipulation*
5. `NumPy` - *Numerical operations* and matrix manipulation

# To use this project on windows, you need to do the following things 

1. When you will download the forked clone of this project you will need to install all the libraries in virtual environment, for this open your cloned project folder, click on the path of the folder and clear the path and type *cmd* the *command terminal* will open.

   To start virtual environment here are the commands
   `python -m venv .env`

   `.anv\Scripts\activate`
   
   after running project
   
   `deactivate`
