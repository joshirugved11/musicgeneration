# Music and Sound Generation
This repository is all about generating AI sound or music using the HuggingFace[**Transformers**] library and training the music generation model using **PyTorch**. 

The libraries used for this project are as specified 
1. `Transformers`[`HuggingFace`] - Using *pretrained models* for language and audio tasks
2. `PyTorch` - Deep Learning framework for *model building and training*
3. `Librosa` - *Audio analysis* and feature extraction
4. `Matplotlib` - Data visualisation for music analysis
5. `Pydub` - Audio *file conversion and manipulation*
6. `NumPy` - *Numerical operations* and matrix manipulation
